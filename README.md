# CSV importer for Dutch election results
This is a Java program that imports Dutch election results from a CSV file which can be found at: https://data.overheid.nl/dataset/verkiezingsuitslag-tweede-kamer-2023 (elections results of the Dutch House of Representatives 2023).

## Why did I create this importer?
For my research into algorithms, I needed to create the most efficient algorithm to import the election results.
The previous importer I used was slow and inefficient, so I decided to create a new importer that is faster and more efficient.

## Open source
I dedicate this importer to other students who might need it and others who are interested in the Dutch election results. Feel free to use this importer for your own projects.
This importer uses official data from data.overheid.nl, and the data comes from the Dutch electoral council (Kiesraad in Dutch).
MIT Licence applies, which is an open source licence that allows you to use this importer for free and without any restrictions.

You can even use it in closed source projects.
